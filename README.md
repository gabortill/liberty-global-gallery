# The Rules
1. Your source code must be in JavaScript (e.g. not CoffeeScript);
2. You can use any third party libraries, but we prefer you used plain JavaScript as much as possible;
3. Show how you would "do it right".

# Tasks
* Load data from http://lg-devtest.herokuapp.com/data.json, use the value Bearer u12A8f3Zg for the "Authorization" header.
* Filter only movies of type "Action", sort the results by IMDB rating (descending).
* Display the results in a horizontal "carousel", showing the box art image, the title, and the IMDB rating for each item.
* Adjust the width of the carousel so that only three items are visible at any given time.
* Implement mouse and keyboard navigation (arrow keys) to move the row of items to the left or right by one, animate the navigation using CSS transitions.
